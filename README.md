# Belly-Button-Diversity

## Overview

Roza took samples of bacteria from subject's belly buttons to determine if they were suitable to manufacture synthetic beef. With the dashboard we created, we'll be able to take a look at each subject to see if they have the right bacteria we are looking for.

Our dashboard can be viewed here: https://jacoblgarrison.github.io/Belly-Button-Diversity/
